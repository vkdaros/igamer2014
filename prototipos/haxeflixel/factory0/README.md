Factory 0 - Prototype
=====================

This is the first prototype to test if it is feasible to use
[HaxeFlixel](http://haxeflixel.com/ "HaxeFlixel") to make the game.

The objectives are:
* Show isometric tiles;
* Move and object from one tile to another;
* Test to publish for Linux, Flash and Android.

### Building
You can easily test on Linux with Neko. In prototype directory run:

```
lime build neko
lime run neko
```

Or alternatively just:

```
lime test neko
```
