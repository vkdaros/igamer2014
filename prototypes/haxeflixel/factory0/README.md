Factory 0 - Prototype
=====================

This is the first prototype to test if it is feasible to use
[HaxeFlixel](http://haxeflixel.com/ "HaxeFlixel") to make the game.

The objectives are:
* Show isometric tiles;
* Move and object from one tile to another;
* Test to publish for Linux, Flash and Android.

You can easily test on Linux with Neko. In prototype directory run:

```
lime build linux
lime run linux
```

Or alternatively just:

lime test linux
```

### Debugging
